# Lox

Implementation of an interpreter for Lox language in F#.

Lox is a dynamically typed, interpreted language created by Bob Nystrom in his book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/). I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning how to create an interpreter.

This project is following along with the book and implementing the interpreter in F#.
